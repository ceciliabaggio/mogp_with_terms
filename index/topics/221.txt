Camping is most commonly defined as an outdoor recreational activity involving living temporarily in the outdoors, usually in a tent or recreational vehicle with the purpose of getting away from civilization and enjoying nature. Camping describes a range of activities from survivalist campers who set off with little more than their boots to those who arrive in large recreational vehicles equipped with their own electricity, plumbing, and patio furniture.
