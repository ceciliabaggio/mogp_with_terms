Pagan is a label on a group of religions. It covers both the resurrection, recreation or revival of old pre-Christian religions (often defined from the perspective of the Roman empire) but also covers new religions who have adopted the label. Some pagans are polytheistic and believe in a whole pantheon of gods, spirits and so on while others may believe in just two gods (usually a male and female) and some are monotheistic.\

    Please make an effort to find the most specific sub-category in which a site belongs; the main Pagan category is only for sites of broad interest to <em>all</em> pagans.
